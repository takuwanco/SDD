## [1.0.3] - 2026-04-14

### Added

- **spec-ai-writer / OpenRouter & Local LLM support**: The existing `openai` provider now accepts `OPENAI_BASE_URL` and `OPENAI_MODEL`, making it a unified path for the official OpenAI API, OpenRouter, and OpenAI-compatible local servers (Ollama, LM Studio, llama.cpp). When `OPENAI_BASE_URL` points at a local endpoint, `OPENAI_API_KEY` may be left empty (Issue #59).
- **spec-ai-writer / Web UI settings page**: New `/settings` page in the dashboard lets users edit the active provider, base URL, model ID, API keys and temperature without restarting the server. Presets are provided for OpenAI Official / OpenRouter / Ollama / LM Studio / Custom (Issue #59).
- **spec-ai-writer / Settings persistence layer**: LLM settings edited from the UI are written atomically to `data/llm_settings.json` with `0600` permissions and overlaid on top of environment variables. `GET /api/settings/llm` returns masked API keys; `PUT /api/settings/llm` ignores empty key fields so re-submitting a masked display value never overwrites the stored secret (Issue #59).

### Changed

- **spec-ai-writer / `reload_settings()`**: Now mutates the existing global Settings instance in place so that module-level references captured by routers observe the updated values without a process restart.
- **spec-ai-writer / `.env.example`**: Added `OPENAI_BASE_URL` and `OPENAI_MODEL` entries with usage examples for OpenRouter, Ollama and LM Studio.
- **spec-ai-writer / `docs/LLM_SETUP.md`**: Added OpenRouter and Local LLM (Ollama / LM Studio / llama.cpp) setup sections and a note about the Web UI settings page.

### Fixed

- **spec-ai-writer / Version alignment between Python package and frontend**: Unified the `spec-ai-writer` version across `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`, `frontend/package.json`, `frontend/package-lock.json`, the FastAPI app metadata, the Click CLI banner and the dashboard footer. All now report **1.0.3** (Issue #60).
- **CONTRIBUTING.md / CONTRIBUTING_ja.md**: Added a "Releasing spec-ai-writer" section documenting which files must be bumped together so this desynchronization cannot recur (Issue #60).

## [1.0.2] - 2026-04-07

### Fixed

- **spec-ai-writer / CSP (Content Security Policy)**: Fixed CSP error when accessing via 127.0.0.1 in production mode (Issue #56)
- **spec-ai-writer / `.env.example`**: Fixed API base URL description (Issue #56)

---

## [1.0.1] - 2026-03-24

### Changed

- **README.md / README_ja.md**: Added spec-ai-writer section with link to `spec-ai-writer/README.md` and unified section order between English and Japanese versions
- **spec-ai-writer/README.md**: Added Python and TypeScript language/framework badges
- **CHANGELOG.md / CONTRIBUTING.md / SECURITY.md**: Split into English default + `_ja.md` Japanese versions with language switch links

---
