This repository is the **practice repository** used in *Spec-Driven Development: A Practical Introduction*.
In the book, it is referred to as the "practice repository" or "SDD repository."

The name "SDD" stands for **Spec-Driven Development**. This remote repository contains sample files organized around the "4 Principles and 7 Processes of Spec-Driven Development" described in the book, and serves as **a reference for how to structure a repository in real projects**.

> For readers of the book: Please check the [Errata](./docs/guides/errata.md) for any known corrections.

## Purpose of This Repository

By referencing this remote repository, you can better understand the overall picture of Spec-Driven Development.
This repository lets you practice writing specifications with Cursor while reading the book:

- Cloning or forking a remote repository with Cursor
- Editing README.md in your local clone of the forked repository
- Improving specifications through dialogue with AI
- Basic Git operations (commit, push)

**Important**: This remote repository is for reference only. If you want to make edits, always fork it first and then clone your own remote repository to work locally.

## Use Cases

- **Book Practice**: Follow along with *Spec-Driven Development: A Practical Introduction* and explore the 7-process sample files hands-on
- **SDD Adoption Reference**: Use this repository as a structural template when introducing Spec-Driven Development to your team or organization
- **Learning How to Write Specifications**: Refer to concrete examples of each process deliverable (project charters, specifications, design plans, etc.)

## Fork vs Clone (Important)

GitHub has two similar but distinct operations: **Fork** and **Clone**. It is important to use each one for the right purpose.

### What is a Fork?
- Copies this repository **under your own GitHub account**
- Since it becomes your own repository, you can:
  - Edit it freely
  - Commit and push changes
  - Work without affecting the original repository

### What is a Clone?
- Copies a GitHub repository **to your local machine (PC)**
- Cloning alone does not create your own repository on GitHub

### Fork vs Clone Comparison

| Item | Fork (operation on GitHub) | Direct Clone (saves to local repository) |
|------|---------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Creates your own repository on GitHub | ✅ | ❌ |
| Allows free editing and pushing of README.md | ✅ | ❌ |
| Failures don't affect the original repository | ✅ | ✅ |
| Can submit Pull Requests | ✅ | ❌ |
| For reference/viewing only | △ | ✅ |
| Recommended use in this repository | **Editing & Practice** | **Viewing Only** |

## Usage

### 1. Fork or Clone This Remote Repository

**Recommended: Fork**

1. Open this remote repository on GitHub (https://github.com/elvezjp/SDD)
2. Click the "Fork" button in the upper right to fork it to your account
3. Clone your forked repository locally with Cursor:
   - From the Cursor menu, select "File" > "Clone Repository"
   - Enter the URL of your forked repository (e.g., `https://github.com/your-username/SDD.git`)
   - Select a destination folder and click "Clone"

In recent versions of Cursor, **"File > Clone Repository" may not appear in the menu**.
In that case, use the **Command Palette** approach.

**For Reference Only (Direct Clone)**

1. From the Cursor menu, select "File" > "Clone Repository"
2. Enter the following URL:
   ```
   https://github.com/elvezjp/SDD.git
   ```
3. Select a destination folder
4. Click "Clone"

### 2. Open and Review README.md

After cloning or forking, open `README.md` in the left Explorer panel.

**Note**: Avoid editing this remote repository (elvezjp/SDD) directly. If you want to make edits, always fork it first and clone your own remote repository to work locally.

### 3. Write Specifications While Dialoguing with AI

In the AI chat panel on the right, try asking questions like:

- "Please read this README.md and tell me what information should be added."
- "Are there any unclear points in this specification?"
- "Is this written clearly?"

### 4. Save and Share Your Changes (if you cloned your forked repository)

Once you have finished editing locally:

1. Save with `Ctrl+S` (or `Cmd+S` on Mac)
2. Tell the AI chat "commit and push"
   - Or manually commit and push from the Source Control panel

**Note**: Do not push directly to this remote repository (elvezjp/SDD). Only push to your forked repository.

## The 4 Principles and 7 Processes of Spec-Driven Development

This remote repository is structured around the following principles and processes:

### 4 Principles

1. **Specifications are "living documents"**: They evolve alongside the project
2. **Specifications are the "single source of truth"**: Referenced by all team members
3. **Specifications assume "change and iteration"**: Updated while recording change history
4. **Reduce costs with AI**: Leverage AI for specification refinement and review

### 7 Processes

Each process is managed in a single Markdown file:

1. **Principle Definition**: [`examples/01-principle-definition.md`](examples/01-principle-definition.md) (Project Charter)
2. **Planning & Requirements**: [`examples/02-planning-requirement.md`](examples/02-planning-requirement.md) (Specification)
3. **Design Planning**: [`examples/03-design-planning.md`](examples/03-design-planning.md) (Design Plan)
4. **Task Breakdown**: [`examples/04-task-breakdown.md`](examples/04-task-breakdown.md) (Task Breakdown)
5. **Implementation**: [`examples/05-implementation.md`](examples/05-implementation.md) (Implementation Log)
6. **Verification & Acceptance**: [`examples/06-verification-acceptance.md`](examples/06-verification-acceptance.md) (Verification Log)
7. **Migration & Operations**: [`examples/07-migration-operation.md`](examples/07-migration-operation.md) (Operations Log)

## Sample Project: Customer Management System

The `examples/` directory contains a sample "Customer Management System" specification covering all 7 processes:

- **Principle Definition**: How to write a project charter
- **Planning & Requirements**: How to write a specification and operate by the 4 principles
- **Design Planning**: Technology stack selection and AI utilization examples
- **Task Breakdown**: Task decomposition granularity and progress management
- **Implementation**: AI-assisted implementation and review records
- **Verification & Acceptance**: Specification diff reports and acceptance testing
- **Migration & Operations**: Operations improvement cycles and feedback integration

Each sample file clearly indicates which process it belongs to.

## spec-ai-writer (Specification Generation Tool)

The `spec-ai-writer/` directory contains an optional AI tool that supports Spec-Driven Development. It conducts interviews via LLM API and automatically generates specification documents for all 7 processes (requires Python 3.9+ and Node.js).

For setup instructions and usage details, see [spec-ai-writer/README.md](spec-ai-writer/README.md).

## FAQ

### Q: Can I edit this remote repository?

A: **This remote repository (elvezjp/SDD) is for reference only, and you do not have permission to edit it directly.** If you want to try editing, fork it first and then clone your forked repository to work locally.

**Fork steps**:
